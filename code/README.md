# Awesome code
README containing links to awesome open source codes.
Most of them are PyTorch code because it is my favorite deep learning frameworks

* [Facebook Detectron plateform](https://github.com/ignacio-rocco/detectorch)
    * Inference only
* [Temporal Convolution](https://github.com/locuslab/TCN/tree/master/TCN)
    * Experimental study of Convolution (dilated, causal) over time vs RNN
* [PyTorch for Computer Vision](https://github.com/youansheng/pytorch-cv)
    * Some tools for doing object detection and pose estimation on image
* [Neural relational inference for interacting systems](https://github.com/ethanfetaya/NRI)
    * Need to take a look at it
